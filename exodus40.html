        <h1>Exodus 40</h1>
        <p><strong>God commands us to do things.</strong> When we do exactly as the Lord commands, exactly as he commands, we become obedient.</p>
        <p><strong>Obedience to God invites God‘s presence.</strong> The importance of obedience and worship – God‘s presence comes when things are done according to His will, not human ideas.</p>
        <p>The Tabernacle represents a heavenly blueprint given to Israel – mirroring the Garden of Eden – foreshadowing the future temple in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p><strong>Obedience to God is tied to intimacy with Him.</strong> Worship is about God‘s terms, not our preferences.</p>
        <p><strong>God‘s glory is so powerful, not even Moses could enter the Tabernacle.</strong></p>
        <p>The Tabernacle becomes a meeting place where God and man reconnect – a temporary solution pointing us towards Jesus.</p>
        <p><strong>Jesus is the ultimate Tabernacle – God dwelling in human form.</strong></p>
        <p>The Holy Spirit is now God‘s presence in us (<strong>1 Corinthians 3:16</strong>), fulfilling what the Tabernacle represents in Exodus 40.</p>
        <p>In <strong>Revelation 21:3</strong>, the final vision is God dwelling permanently with His people, just like in Exodus – but now in a heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, rather than a tent in the wilderness.</p>
        <p><strong>God desires to dwell with His people, but it requires of us obedience and holiness.</strong></p>
        <p>The Tabernacle is a pattern of God‘s plan – from Eden to the temple, to Jesus, to the Holy Spirit, and finally to eternity.</p>
        <p><strong>God‘s presence brings guidance.</strong> He leads us today through the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>The chapter concludes with movement – journeying to the Promised Land, just as we are journeying towards God‘s final redemption.</p>
        <p><strong>Deepest meaning?</strong> Exodus 40 is about restoring what was lost in Eden — His presence among His people. A sign of what was, what is, and what will be.</p>
        <p>God with man in the beginning, God leading Israel, and God dwelling with us forever in Christ.</p>
