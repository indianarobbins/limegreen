        <h1>Exodus 40</h1>
        <p>Exodus 40

God commands us to do things.
When we do exactly as the Lord commands, exactly as he commands, we become obedient.
Obedience to God invites God‘s presence.
Importance of obedience and worship – God‘s presence comes when things are done according to His will, not human ideas.
The tabernacle represents a heavenly blueprint given to Israel – mirroring the garden of Eden – foreshadowing the future temple in Jerusalem
Obedience to God is tied to intimacy with Him

Worship is about God‘s terms, not our preferences

God‘s glory is so powerful, not even Moses could enter the tabernacle.
The Tabernacle becomes a meeting place where God and man reconnect – a temporary solution pointing us towards Jesus.
Jesus is the ultimate Tabernacle – God dwelling in human form.

The Holy Spirit is now God‘s presence in us (1 Corinthians 3:16) fulfilling what the Tabernacle represents in Exodus 40

In Revelation 21:3, the final vision is God dwelling permanently with His people, just like in Exodus – but now in a heavenly city, the new Jerusalem, rather than a tent in the wilderness

God desires to dwell with His people, but it requires of Us obedience and Holiness 

The Tabernacle is a pattern of God‘s plan – from Eden to the temple, to Jesus, to the Holy Spirit, and finally to eternity.

God‘s presence brings guidance. He leads us today through the Holy Spirit 

Chapter concludes with movement – journeying to the promised land, just as we are journeying towards God‘s final redemption

Deepest meaning? Exodus 40 is about restoring what was lost in Eden — His presence among his people. 
A sign of what was, what is, and what will be.
God, with man in the beginning, God leading Israel, and God dwelling with us forever in Christ .</p>
