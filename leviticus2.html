        <h1>Leviticus 2</h1>
        <p>The grain offering presents human effort and labor since grain must be harvested, ground, and prepared.</p>
        <p>A symbol of our work, when offered to God, becomes a sacred act.</p>
        <p>Worship isn’t limited to animal sacrifice or dramatic rituals, but includes the offering of everyday life and work in service to God.</p>
        <p>Offering our daily work to God.</p>
        <p>Grain was the foundation of Israel’s diet as Jesus is the “bread of life.”</p>
        <p>Offering the first portion of grain back to God reminds us that all provisions come from Him.</p>
        <p>A daily reliance on God for spiritual sustenance. <em>“Give us this day our daily bread.”</em></p>
        <p><strong>Elements in the grain offering:</strong></p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li><strong>Fine flour</strong> = Purity, refinement, removal of coarseness (sin).</li>
            <li><strong>Oil</strong> = The Holy Spirit - empowerment, anointing, consecration.</li>
            <li><strong>Frankincense</strong> = Prayer and worship rising to God.</li>
            <li><strong>No leaven or honey</strong> = Yeast represents sin, corruption, and pride. Honey, while sweet, symbolizes fleeting pleasures that don’t last in God’s presence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Jesus as the perfect offering:</strong> Free of sin (leaven), offered completely to God, just as the grain offering was consumed by fire.</p>
        <p><em>“The life of Christ was a pleasing aroma to God.”</em></p>
        <p><strong>Every grain offering includes salt,</strong> a preservative that symbolizes covenant faithfulness.</p>
        <p><em>“You are the salt of the Earth.”</em> – Believers are to preserve righteousness.</p>
        <p><strong>Worship is not just about sacrifices,</strong> but a lifestyle of offering everything – our work, our sustenance, and our devotion to God.</p>
        <p><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong> Christ as the ultimate bread. Purity, commitment, and nourishment of the spirit.</p>
