        <h1>Exodus 34</h1>
        <p>Smaller compromises lead to bigger falls. Solomon didn’t start worshiping idols; he began making alliances and marriages.</p>
        <p>Spiritual compromise always leads to destruction, even if it seems harmless at first. Eliminate anything that pulls us away from God. Destroy spiritual strongholds in our minds and hearts that exalt themselves against God.</p>
        <p>Any habit, object, or influence that draws us into sin must be removed. Compromise leads to spiritual weakness – fully destroy pagan worship.</p>
        <p>If we allow sin to remain in our lives, it will take root and grow. Remove temptations completely; eliminate the source, not just resist it. Destroying idols leads to revival.</p>
        <p>Purify yourself from influences that lead away from God.</p>
        <p>Israel’s greatest failures happened when they ignored the command. Their greatest revivals happened when they obeyed it.</p>
        <p>Worship is what the heart adores.</p>
        <p><b>Qanna</b> - jealous, zealous, possessive, fierce, love protection. God's Qanna means he doesn’t tolerate divided devotion. God demands loyalty.</p>
        <p>“Love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, soul, and mind.”</p>
        <p>Heart – emotions, desires in life.<br>
        Soul – the whole life force, the essence of being.<br>
        Mind – intellect, thought, reasoning.</p>
        <p>The soul is what makes a person alive – the fusion of God‘s breath with the body. The soul exists beyond physical life and continues after death – the soul is eternal.</p>
        <p>Emotional devotion, intellectual understanding, devoting our entire existence to Him. Living for Him daily, aligning our desires with His will, setting our eternity in Him.</p>
        <p>Making treaties with idol-worshiping cultures leads to compromise (example: King Solomon). Anytime God’s people turn away from Him, it’s like adultery.</p>
        <p>Eating the sacrifices of idolaters is participation in idolatry: entertainment, beliefs, relationships, etc. normalize idolatry, blur lines, and lead to spiritual compromise.</p>
        <p>Do not compromise with idolatry (money, power, relationships, feasts, self-worship, greed). Who we eat with forms close bonds and affects our faith.</p>
        <p>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers – be very cautious.</p>
        <p>Spiritual adultery is dangerous. Idolatry isn’t just false worship but a betrayal of our covenant with God. “Friendship with the world is enmity with God.”</p>
        <p>If we compromise in small ways, we may end up enslaved to idols.</p>
        <p>Worshiping a false image of God is still idolatry – many people reshape God into what they want Him to be instead of worshiping Him as He truly is.</p>
        <p>God judges sin.</p>
        <p>What we make can end up controlling us. “Those who make idols will become like them.”</p>
        <p>Whatever you worship, you serve. If you worship success, you will serve it with your whole life. If you worship love, you will compromise anything to keep it. If you worship comfort, you never grow.</p>
        <p>If you worship God, you align with purpose, power, and presence.</p>
        <p>Idols enslave you; God sets you free. Idols leave you empty; God fills you with life.</p>
        <p>If you truly worship God, you will not be ruled by addictions, fear, anxiety, or toxic relationships.</p>
        <p>You get true identity and purpose when you worship God. You don’t have to search for meaning in relationships, careers, or status.</p>
        <p>Worshiping God only means your peace doesn’t depend on money, relationships, or success.</p>
        <p>When you prioritize God, He takes care of your needs. You get strength and protection – God fights for you.</p>
        <p>You get eternal life. Idols die.</p>
        <p>When you worship God alone, you don’t have to chase success, seek approval, or fear loss. God gives you purpose, knows and loves you, and provides security.</p>
