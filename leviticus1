        <h1>Leviticus 1</h1>
        <p>God is dwelling among Israel—but sets boundaries for how sinful humans can approach His presence.</p>
        <p>The burnt offerings were the most valuable cattle, sheep, or birds—animals that cost the worshiper something.</p>
        <p><strong>Forgiveness requires blood.</strong> This is about atonement – a life is given to cover sin. This is very serious and foreshadows Jesus.</p>
        <p>The person, not the priest, must kill the animal—enforcing personal responsibility for sin.</p>
        <p>Blood represents life, which is the price of redemption.</p>
        <p>Washing entrails and legs symbolizes an internal purification and the purification of one’s walk – essential aspects of holiness.</p>
        <p>The heart, intestines, and inner parts symbolize thoughts, emotions, and motives.</p>
        <p>Before offering ourselves to God, we need a cleansing of the heart and inner being—true worship isn’t just external; it starts from within.</p>
        <p><strong>“First clean the inside of the cup and dish, so that the outside of it may also become clean.”</strong></p>
        <p>God isn’t interested in outward acts of worship—He wants a clean heart and pure motives. <strong>“Create in me a clean heart, O God.”</strong></p>
        <p>The legs represent our journey, actions, and lifestyle—walking represents our way of life.</p>
        <p>Jesus washed the disciples' feet – even those who literally followed Jesus needed a cleansing in their daily walk.</p>
        <p>Leviticus 1 parallels this: the worshiper brings an offering, but even the legs (the means by which they walk and carry themselves in life) must be washed before being accepted.</p>
        <p>Holiness is not just about internal purity but how we live, move, and act daily.</p>
        <p>The burnt offering was completely consumed by fire after being washed, meaning the whole person—inside and out—is given to God.</p>
        <p><strong>“Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.”</strong></p>
        <p>Being purified in heart and actions before fully offering oneself to God.</p>
        <p>A complete cleansing of the inner heart and outer walk before coming into God’s presence.</p>
        <p>Foreshadows Jesus cleansing us completely—inside (heart, mind, motives) and outside (our daily walk in actions). True worship requires both internal transformation and a purified life.</p>
        <p>Burnt offerings are completely consumed, representing total devotion and giving oneself fully to God.</p>
        <p><strong>Fire is God‘s refining power</strong>—purifying and transforming what is given to Him.</p>
        <p>Blood on the altar foreshadows Jesus’ blood on the cross, which grants us access to God.</p>
        <p>If they couldn’t afford a bull, they could bring a sheep or a goat; if they couldn’t afford that, they could bring a dove or a pigeon.</p>
        <p><strong>God makes a way, regardless of wealth.</strong></p>
        <p>Worship is about the heart, not the size of the offering. Even the poorest person had access to God—just as Jesus made salvation available to all.</p>
        <p>Jesus is the ultimate burnt offering—completely given over to God’s will.</p>
        <p><strong>The Lamb of God who takes on the sin of the world.</strong></p>
        <p>Jesus’ death replaced the burnt offering system. His sacrifice was once and for all.</p>
        <p>God desires wholehearted devotion – the burnt offering was completely consumed, as we are called to offer ourselves fully to God.</p>
        <p><strong>Forgiveness requires a substitute.</strong> Sin is serious, and atonement comes through the shedding of blood, ultimately fulfilled in Christ's sacrifice.</p>
        <p>God provides a way for everyone—rich or poor—to access Him, as we all have access to Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>The Israelites needed the offering; we need Jesus to enter God’s presence.</p>
        <p><strong>Only through a substitute sacrifice can a sinful person approach a holy God.</strong> This foreshadows Jesus, the perfect sacrifice, and calls us to total surrender in worship.</p>
